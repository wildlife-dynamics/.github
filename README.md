# Ecoscope Shared GitHub configurations

This repository contains shared GitHub configuration for the Wildlife Dynamics
organization. It provides organization-wide issue forms and reusable workflows
that can be called from other repositories.

## Issue forms

- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/Feature.yml` collects a user story, notes, and optional
  acceptance criteria.
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/Bug.yml` collects reproduction steps, expected and
  actual behavior, notes, and optional acceptance criteria.

## Reusable workflows

- `.github/workflows/_automerge-auto-approve-prs.yml` enables squash auto-merge for
  non-draft pull requests labeled `automerge` and auto-approves matching
  `ecoscope-elebot` pull requests.
- `.github/workflows/_check-pull-requests-mention-linked-issue.yml` checks that a
  pull request links to a sufficiently detailed issue.
- `.github/workflows/_initialize-refinement-and-request-qa-review-for-features-and-bugs.yml`
  initializes refinement status and requests QA review.

Usage and caller examples are documented at the top of each workflow.

### Automerge setup

In each calling repository:

- Enable **Allow auto-merge** and **Allow squash merging** in repository settings.
- Create the `automerge` label.
- Provide `ECOSCOPE_ELEBOT_PAT` as an Actions secret, with access to merge pull
  requests in that repository.
- Enable **Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests** for automatic
  approval of `ecoscope-elebot` pull requests.
- Grant the calling job `pull-requests: write`, as shown in the workflow example.

GitHub's required approvals, checks, and branch update requirements still apply.
The reusable workflow must be merged here before callers reference it on `main`.

## Contributing

- Reusable workflow names should start with `_`.
- Update a workflow's usage comments whenever its inputs or behavior change.

### Local checks

Install [`prek`](https://prek.j178.dev/installation/), then install this
repository's Git hooks:

```sh
prek install
```

The checks run automatically before every commit and push. They validate GitHub
Actions workflows with `actionlint`, issue forms with `check-jsonschema`, and
workflow security with `zizmor`.

Run every check manually with:

```sh
prek run --all-files
```
